             <p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">Think of leather jacket dry cleaners in Bhopal, think of the The leather Craft!</p>
             <p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">Leather being a product of nature has a technical cleaning process. Generic dry cleaning of leather jackets does not always help to get rid of stains (ink, grease, water marks etc). Thus it becomes essential to consult a professional leather jacket dry cleaner. We here at Leather Craft, carefully inspect your jacket & remove dirt, grime and obvious stains. We then finish up by polishing and restoring the colour of the entire jacket! For the final touch, we soften the jacket by applying a thin coat of wax that also helps to revive the original sheen! We also conduct extensive anti-fungal treatments to remove any mold & mildew growth. Dry and cracking leather jackets are reconditioned with rehydrating creams. We also remove creases or wrinkles from jackets, making them look nice and fresh!</p>
