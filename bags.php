        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		With everyday use, leather bags tend to lose their color, shine and freshness. Canvas and cloth bags (especially of a light color) also tend to get grubby over time.
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Dirt & Dust – Excessive use causes soil build up on leather. This destroys the original color and texture of handbags (handles and the base of the bag tend to wear off the fastest). Exposure to sunlight results in color fading.
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Dye Transfer – Bags of a light color are very susceptible to staining due to dye transfer from darker colors. Denim rub-off is the most common problem.
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Ink stains – A leaky pen not only stains the body of the bag but can also stains the inside lining of handbags
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Grease/ Oil Stains – Leather is porous in nature. Grease from hand creams, lotions, lip balm etc can very easily seep into leather, leaving behind a ghastly blotch. Natural body oils can also easily rub into leather, destroying it’s surface!
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Perspiration - Perspiration from our hands also destroys the surface coating of leather over time, resulting in color fading.
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Dehydration – In dry and hot weather conditions, the natural oils in animal hide tend to evaporate, causing the leather of your handbags to shrink and crack up.
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Mold & Mildew - Excessive dampness and moisture results in the growth of mold and fungus on the leather’s surface. If not attended to immediately, it will not only grow rapidly but will also spill on to other leather items!
        	</p>
        	<p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #818181;">
        		Leather is a product of nature and has a technical and specialized cleaning process. Therefore you must always consult professional handbag dry cleaners for all your precious suede, patent and leather handbags, belts, travel bags and wallets!
